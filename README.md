## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The Junpyter Notebook is written using Python 3 with default Anaconda Distribution and several other libraries. In specific, the following libraries should be installed:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- wordcloud
- re
If you start with Anaconda default, then you should only need to install wordcloud (which is done in Notebook, so you only need to run the Notebook)

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I analyzed Airbnb Seattle listings with a focus on the hosts. I tried to look at how super hosts are different from usual hosts. The dataset I used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle). I foxus on using text data inside to capture the themes that differentiates the hosts

The questions that guide my analysis are

1. What's ratio of super hosts and how long does it take to be oneï¼Ÿ
2. What do super hosts do when they edit their listings (listing names, summaries, descriptions)?
3. What do customers care about/ recognize in the super hosts?
